# LonelyStars
LonelyStars adds Time States (Morning, Evening, Night) to WEBFISHING, while trying to stay as faithful as possible to the original game's art style.

Currently it changes the world environment to look like the time that it is currently (this can be either an in-game time cycle or your real life time), it adds fireflies around the world during evening and night, a light around the campfire and makes the lighthouse light up at night, with many more planned.

### Config
You can toggle each of the features on and off in the in-game config menu (TackleBox).

The mod also features hot-reloading for the config options, meaning any change you make to the config will reflect instantly in the game.

### LSTAPI
LSTAPI is a sister project to this one and was developed alongside LonelyStars to solve a problem with time related WEBFISHING mods, it's an API for Mod Authors to tap into LonelyStars' time varible and do whatever they want in relation to that, examples: turn on your own mod's lights when it turns night, when the clock hits noon play a sound, stuff like that, if that interests you can take a look [here](https://github.com/misterj05/LSTAPI)!
